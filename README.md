# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This repository consist of ML experiments in form of notebook, which looks into using various Python-libraries of Machine Learning and Data Science in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
